# INPUT
Unknown words, which we defined as words that the user spends extra time thinking about, can significantly increase the reading difficulty for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners [19, 26], since vocabulary knowledge is considered an essential feature of reading ability. Automatic detection of unfamiliar words can help users improve reading fluency and reading experience [14]. Previ- ous works used eye movement features such as fixation duration and the number of regressions to detect unknown words, consid- ering the strong correlation between eye movement and reading difficulty [7, 9, 18]. However, all these methods are based on dedi- cated eye-tracking devices. Even for portable eye trackers, prices of hundreds or thousands of dollars prevent most people from using these technologies in their daily lives.
The ubiquity of webcams makes it possible to track eye move- ment non-obtrusively. Researchers have used webcam-based eye- tracking methods to analyze users’ reading behavior [13], but the low precision [21] makes it infeasible to extract eye movement features proposed by previous works. Therefore, these reading anal- ysis approaches cannot be directly transferred to webcam-based unknown word detection, which requires fine-grained tracking.
In this work, we detect unknown words using the webcam for ESL learners by integrating gaze and text information with the help of transformer-based language models. Our method tracks eye movement using WebGazer [22] and embeds the positional information of gaze and texts with Long Short-term Memory [10] (LSTM) models. In order to improve the model’s performance given only noisy gaze data acquired by webcam, we leverage pre-trained language models to encode the context information for assistance. The gaze and context data are then fed to the model’s classifier to predict the targeted unknown word. The F1-score of our model is 75.73% which is higher than the text- and gaze-only model. We also conduct a user study to discover the needs of ESL learners and explore the design scope according to our method. The results show that our future design should focus more on proper nouns, multi-meaning words, and long and complex sentences, as well as exploring ways to reduce disturbance to the user’s reading process through interactive design. In summary, the main contributions of this work include the following:
1) We propose GazeReader, a novel webcam-based unknown word detecting method that leverages gaze and text information for ESL learners. The accuracy is 98.09%, the F1-score is 75.73%, and the cross-user F1-score is 78.26%.
2) We explore the design scope for ESL reading based on our method, guiding our future design direction towards proper nouns, multi-meaning words, and long and complex sentences.
